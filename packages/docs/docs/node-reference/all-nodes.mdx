| [Match](./match.mdx)             | Matches a string input against a series of regular expressions, routing control flow based on the content of the string. Executes the output port for each matching regular expression and the `Unmatched` output port if no match is found.                                                     |
| [Passthrough](./passthrough.mdx) | Transfers the input value directly to the output without modification.
