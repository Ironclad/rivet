I am working on developing an AI storyboarding tool that allows users to create a series of prompts for a language model in a choose-your-own-adventure format. The tool is inspired by node-based editors, like the one found in Blender, where users can create nodes on a page that have inputs and outputs that can be connected by wires to form a web of connections between the prompts and the AI. Each node can be edited, and when editing, a larger window pops up with a text editor where users can tweak various aspects of the prompt that will be fed to the AI. This tool will provide a user-friendly interface for crafting interactive stories with an AI language model. Here is a tree of my current files for context. If you would like the contents of any of these files, please ask. The app is dark-themed and the colors are available in index.css. I'm using Emotion for CSS.
